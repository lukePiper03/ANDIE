Image export testing log:

To test the export method, let us break down the users possible input into all possible cases below. 

Case 1:
If you try and export an image when no image has been opened an error message pops up; "No image exists to be exported. 
Try opening an image first."
 
Case 2:
If you open an image of a file of type JPEG, PNG, BMP, WEBMP, or GIF (support by Java), you can select the exported 
images location and enter a filename. The image will. Then be saved as filename.png in the correct location with all 
applied filters.

Note that no matte what the user enters as the filename the image export will not break as the only delimiter that is 
"important" is the .png that the export method does independently.

Case 3:
If the user try to enter a filename in a directory where filename.png already exsits an error message appears saying 
"./filename.png file path already exists. Do you want to override the file?" where ./filename.png is the correct file 
path to where the possible overwriting could have occurred. The user can select yes or no. Yes to overwrite the file 
path or and no to renter another filename. This process occurs with no restriction on attempts, as most user 
interfaces do.
